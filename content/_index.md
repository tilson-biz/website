## Start using **The Cloud**

{{< hint info >}}
You are a start-up thinking on building the first application for your new idea — start using clouds. We can help you build your infrastructure in [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/) or [GCP](https://cloud.google.com/). Already have some on-premise infrastructure — we can help you migrate to clouds. The benefits of using clouds include improving cost efficiency, increasing high availability, enabling scalability, and lowering operational efforts.

## Migrate to IaC

{{< hint info >}}
You just started using clouds but manage your infrastructure using web interfaces or scripts — we can help you migrate your management approach to **Infrastructure as Code**. We use tools like AWS [CloudFormation](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/) and [CDK](https://aws.amazon.com/cdk/), HashiCorp [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io), and GCP [Deployment Manager](https://cloud.google.com/deployment-manager/docs). These will allow your teams to work quickly and more efficiently and will help move them towards [DevOps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DevOps) culture.

## Test-driven Infrastructure

{{< hint info >}}
You manage infrastructure with IaC but fear to make a tiny change to any one of those hundred-lines `tf` or `yaml` files to be sure not to damage production infrastructure — make your processes test driven. We can help you start using tools like HashiCorp [Sentinel](https://www.hashicorp.com/sentinel), [LocalStack](https://localstack.cloud) for AWS, Gruntwork [terratest](https://terratest.gruntwork.io), and other to have confidence in making changes to your infrastructure.

## Cloud-native Applications
{{< hint info >}}
Take a step towards and make your application [cloud-native](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_native_computing). You will be able to run it in modern, dynamic environments. We can help you to migrate your application to a set of [microservices](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microservices) that run in [containers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Containerization_(computing)), orchestrated with [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io), and managed and deployed using [GitOps](https://about.gitlab.com/topics/gitops/) workflow. We use such GitOps tools like [flux](https://fluxcd.io), [flugger](https://fluxcd.io/flagger/), [werf](https://werf.io), [helm](https://helm.sh), and others.
